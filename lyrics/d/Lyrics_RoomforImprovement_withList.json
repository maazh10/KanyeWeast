          "Welcome ladies and gentlemen to our annual recital here at the U.P.A., Urban Pianist Association. Here is the most talented student in my class, Aubrey Drake Graham. It has taken a long time for him to get to this point. Do not get me wrong, he\u2019s not perfect, but he has come a long way since my meeting with his mother. He has made improvement! So Aubrey, show these people what you got man!",
          "Put the Jamie Foxx on them! I won\u2019t be able to see you, but I will be able to hear you from outside, so, I\u2019ll eat my Greek salad and drink that Grey Goose you gave me, mmmm! Anyways, good luck! Hey! Don\u2019t mess up, okay? My ass is on the line!"
